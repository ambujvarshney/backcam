please run:
  mkdir -p /Users/cjoseph/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /Users/cjoseph/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
opencv-python, imutils (pip install opencv-python imutils)
zmq (brew install zmq)
pyzmq (brew install pyzmq)
anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
cvxpy (conda install -c cvxgrp cvxpy libgcc)
tshark (brew install tshark)
ffmpeg (brew install ffmpeg)

1.) start the receiver 
2.) start the processing loop, 'python brains.py'

brains.py reads and processes the images that the receiver outputs into the images_raw/ directory

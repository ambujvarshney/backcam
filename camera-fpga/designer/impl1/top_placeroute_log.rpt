***** Layout Variables *********************************************

Mode: TIMING_DRIVEN
Power-driven Layout: OFF
Incremental Placement: FIX
Incremental Route: ON
High Effort Layout Mode: ON
Repair Hold Violations: ON


Warning: The advanced layout option 'High Effort Layout Mode' is active.
Info: I/O Bank Assigner detected (4) out of (4) I/O Bank(s) with locked I/O technologies.
Info: I/O Bank Assigner is running in incremental mode. All pre-assigned I/O Bank technologies
      will not be changed.
Info: All I/O Banks have locked technologies. Skipping I/O Bank Assigner.

Planning global net placement...
Info: PLC008: Global net clock_control_0_clock_out drives a CCC macro
      input_buffer_0/RCLKBUBBLE_RNIURM3/U_GL. Therefore it must be assigned to a chip global
      resource.


Global net placement completed successfully.

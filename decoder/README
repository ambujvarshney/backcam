Compile
=======

To compile, execute `make decode` in this directory. The name of the binary is
'decode'.

Usage
=====

Feed extracted backscatter payload data to the stdin of the compiled decode
program. For example:

tshark -I -T fields -e data -i en0 | ./decode   # live streaming

Another example:

tshark -r dump.pcap -T fields -e data > dump.txt
cat dump.txt | ./decode                         # record and decode

The new program expects exactly the same input as our old 'newprocess.py'
script.

Scripts
=======

Continuous Streaming
--------------------

To run a streaming demo, execute `bash demo.sh`. Images will automatically
appear in this directory. Stop the demo by Ctrl-C.

Capture and Process
-------------------

First `bash capture.sh` to collect a raw pcap dump. The default duration
of the capture is 20 sec. Then execute `bash process.sh` to process the
captured packets. It will automatically convert the pcap dump to the input
format of the decoder program, and clean up intermediate files afterwards.

camera-fpga: fpga code for the BackCam board, responsible for downlink
	     and backscatter uplink

camera-mcu: MCU driver code for the camera, configures and controls
	    the camera

cloud-processing: legacy python decoder, plus image processing
		  pipeline code (noise removal, face recognition)

compression: python simulation code for compression algorithm eval
	     

decoder: realtime auto-size-adjusting backscatter decoder written in C

demo-setup: some older code demonstrating image capture and receive,
	    useful for debugging

hardware: project files for hardware board design

transmitter: backscatter excitation/downlink transmitter code


NOTE: a 7zipped linux image for the transmitter is at http://web.stanford.edu/~cajoseph/bs-injection.img.7z with MD5 = 88afae37871665a57a705b29aa4d6ca1


NOTE: a serial receiver is in cloud-processing/image-stream-decoding/serial_stream.c (compile instructions in README within directory)
